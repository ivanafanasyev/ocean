# Bio Form

1. **Fullname**
   Why fullname? Because it's less fields, easier to fill usually.
   Try to use First Name and Last Name only if you really need it to.

2. **Email**, nothing to explain. Simple field. Don't forget to use the right inputMode="email"

3. **Nationality**. It's better to do a serchable dropdown, with text highlighting and flags.

4. **Date of birth**. Questionable. But by the best UX practices and user researches, it's better to use 3 separate fields. Date field could be not the best option here.
   Just don't forget to make it focusable, for easy switching by the TAB key.
